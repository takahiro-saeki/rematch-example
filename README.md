and

```
$ npm i json-server -g
```

### step2
launch tab in your terminal, then type below
```
$ npm run server

then change tab in your terminal, after that please type below.

## Why Should You Do Above?
That's because I prepared json-server which is like real server as a mock.
This example is included to use [CRUD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete) manipulation.
You need to launch 2 local-sever, first one is for client debugging, second one is db.
